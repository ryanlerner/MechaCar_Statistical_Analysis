## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- The vehicle length, ground-clearance and intercept provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
- Due to the extremely small p-value, we are able to reject the null hypothesis for linear regression, which would state that the slope is equal to 0. At an alpha level of 0.05, we are able to reject the null hypothesis given that our p-value is 5.35e-11. Thus, we are able to assume that the alternative hypothesis (that the slope does not equal zero) is mostl likely true.
- The adjusted R-squared value of 0.6825 would conclude that the linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar protoypes fairly effectively. The multiple R-Squared value is relatively high due to the amount of variables, but adjusted R-Squared value controls for the extra variables and does not produce a significant decrease.
